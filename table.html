HTML Tables
HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.
Example
A simple HTML table: 
-->
<!--
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th> 
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td> 
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td> 
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>
-->
<!-- 
Table Cells
Each table cell is defined by a <td> and a </td> tag.
td stands for table data.
Everything between <td> and </td> are the content of the table cell.
Note: A table cell can contain all sorts of HTML elements: text, images, lists, links, other tables, etc.
Table Rows
Each table row starts with a <tr> and ends with a </tr> tag.
tr stands for table row.
You can have as many rows as you like in a table; just make sure that the number of cells are the same in each row.
Note: There are times when a row can have less or more cells than another.
Table Headers
Sometimes you want your cells to be table header cells. In those cases use the <th> tag instead of the <td> tag:
th stands for table header.
By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered, but you can change that with CSS.
